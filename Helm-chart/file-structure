Helm chart is  a collection of files that will have the description of Kubernetes clusters and resources.
Helm charts are a combination of Kubernetes YAML manifest templates and helm-specific files. 
You can call it a helm package. 
Since the Kubernetes YAML manifest can be templated, you donâ€™t have to maintain multiple helm charts of different environments. 
Helm uses the go templating engine for the templating functionality.
